# Gene Nomination Analysis Scripts

This directory contains all the scripts used to nominate genes for fine-mapped variants with PIP > 0.01. The scripts were run on the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility's Andes supercomputer.  

These scripts also created the gene and pleiotropy figures referenced in Verma et al. The figures and the scripts that generated them are as follows:

Fig. 4a - Anurag to fill in!  
Fig. 4b - **analyze_gene_nominations.R**  
Fig. 4c - Generated by the following GO-Figure command using outputs from **analyze_gene_nominations.R**:   
        `python /path/to/gofigure.py -i /path/to/go-figure_input.tsv -j standard-plus -si 0.1 -p Blues -e 60 -o pleiotropy_go`
