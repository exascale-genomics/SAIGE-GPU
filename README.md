# SAIGE-GPU
This GitHub repository contains the SAIGE-GPU version of SAIGE.
We have modified the original version of SAIGE step 1, by building the full GRM through distribution to multiple GPUs.

This version was used to run the VA MVP gwPheWAS on the DOE ORNL OLCF Summit HPC.

Please view the [SAIGE-GPU pages](https://exascale-genomics.github.io/SAIGE-GPU/index.html#/) for a more detailed description.
